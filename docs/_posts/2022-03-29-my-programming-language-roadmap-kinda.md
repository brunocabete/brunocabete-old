title: "My programming languages roadmap (kind of)"
---

Ok, I like technology. I can't read anything about a programming language without wanting to learn it's basics, but that's an impossible task, at least without some proper organization.

That's why I'm writing this list of the top languages I'm curious about in no particular order and their respective pros (from my perspective).

## C

- Helps to get a better understanding of the inner workings of computers
- Barebones
- Would be able to understand some old games source code
- Make cool console homebrew apps/ROM hacks
- Used in everything

## Java

- The OG OOP(?)
- Still used a lot
- Android development
- Minecraft mods (and understanding the source code)(is the source code somewhere?)

## Kotlin

- Java but cooler
- Better android development
- Jetbrains is cool

## Python

- Python is python

## Rust

- Web assembly
- Game dev
- Cool name for developers (rustaceans)
- Looks cool to develop in

## Ruby

- Looks tasty as heck to write
- Jekyll is cool (my current obsession)
- Rails for webdev

## Other technologies

### Bash

- Linux automation
- Some cool day to day applications

### PowerShell

- Looks more modern than bash
- Even cooler day to day applications
